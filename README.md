# Flood Prediction Model

- Machine Learning algorithms to predict the chances of Flood in the state of Kerala using the Kerela flood dataset.
- This Model uses 5 Machine Learning Algorithms namely KNN Classification, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest to get the best possible model to predict the floods using GidanKwano Rainfall Data.
